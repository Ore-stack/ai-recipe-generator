# Build a Serverless Web App with AWS Lambda, Amplify, Bedrock, and Cognito

This project demonstrates how to build a serverless web application using AWS services like AWS Lambda, Amazon API Gateway, AWS Amplify, Amazon Bedrock, and Amazon Cognito. The app leverages generative AI capabilities provided by Amazon Bedrock to create a modern, scalable, and secure web application.

## Overview

In this tutorial, you will:
1. Set up a serverless backend using AWS Lambda and Amazon API Gateway.
2. Build a frontend using AWS Amplify.
3. Integrate Amazon Bedrock for generative AI capabilities.
4. Add user authentication using Amazon Cognito.
5. Deploy and test the application.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following:
- An **AWS account** with administrative privileges.
- **AWS CLI** installed and configured on your local machine.
- **Node.js** and **npm** installed for frontend development.
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript, React (or another frontend framework), and AWS services.

## Steps to Build the Application

### 1. Set Up the Backend
1. **Create an AWS Lambda Function**:
   - Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to create a Lambda function.
   - Write the function code to handle API requests and integrate with Amazon Bedrock.

2. **Set Up Amazon API Gateway**:
   - Create a REST API in API Gateway.
   - Connect the API to the Lambda function.
   - Deploy the API and note the endpoint URL.

3. **Integrate Amazon Bedrock**:
   - Use the Bedrock SDK to call generative AI models from your Lambda function.
   - Configure the necessary IAM permissions for Lambda to access Bedrock.

### 2. Build the Frontend
1. **Initialize an AWS Amplify Project**:
   - Run `amplify init` to create a new Amplify project.
   - Add a frontend framework (e.g., React) using `amplify add frontend`.

2. **Connect the Frontend to the Backend**:
   - Use the API Gateway endpoint to fetch data from the Lambda function.
   - Display the results from Amazon Bedrock on the frontend.

3. **Add User Authentication**:
   - Use `amplify add auth` to integrate Amazon Cognito for user authentication.
   - Configure sign-up, sign-in, and user management features.

### 3. Deploy and Test
1. **Deploy the Application**:
   - Run `amplify push` to deploy the backend and frontend to AWS.
   - Use `amplify publish` to host the frontend on AWS Amplify.

2. **Test the Application**:
   - Verify that users can sign up, sign in, and interact with the generative AI features.
   - Test the API Gateway and Lambda integration to ensure smooth functionality.

## Cleanup

To avoid incurring charges, delete the resources created in this tutorial:
1. Delete the Amplify project:
   ```bash
   amplify delete
2. Delete the Lambda function and API Gateway from the AWS Management Console.

3. Remove the Cognito user pool and any other resources.
